# [Week of 08/31/2023] Computational Design #1
I learned how to use Rhino, at first, it was also difficult to get a grip on the four quadrants on the Rhino's screen.
Now I can set display mode set to "Wireframe". 

**Command function**
- Since there are too many icons and functions in the program, it's convenient to use "Command" function like this.

I used more commands below.
- 4View
- _Group(or Ctrl+G)
- Grasshopper(to open Grasshopper)

**Placing objects**
- Set Layer and color code it. When you export, it will automatically be red and easy to adjust for cutting.
- The pieces were placed out of the board, so I used "move to 0" so that it is visible in the illustrator.
- The grid didn't show up, so typed "Grid" and changed "ShowGridAxes=Yes", "ShowGrid=Yes"
- It's Cody's little tips! His favorite settings are like this, and it is convenient to use! 'Onsnap' makes it easier to draw lines.

**Customizing Phonestand to my phone**
1) Measuring
I need to consider the phonecase sizes as well. It was --> H * W * T = 150 * 75 * 12

*"Well...While taking pictures of the process of measuring the phone size with an iPad, I felt once again that I needed a phonestand!"*

3) Adjusting Phone Size

4) Adjusting Student Activity Range and Height

**Bake**
- To make it as a 2D model, I should 'bake' it in Grasshopper.

**Settings for Laser cutting**
- It is helpful to check which area is available to reuse material. (click "Focusview" and set where do you want to set the laser.)

I changed my design's location a little bit to adjust with the reuse material.

- this is the setting for intensity. I could set like this, and it's better to check with fingers after cutting to see if it is well cut.

**Preparation!**
I turned on the laser exhaust switch, checked if air flows, and turned on the compressed air switch!

- I found this sign later, I was almost playing around but I realized that I shouldn't have done that.

**Results**
Succeed!

**In this writing, reflect thoughtfully on your personal performance since last week. Did you take an opportunity to help out a classmate?  Were you able to meet your personal expectations?  What helped or hindered your performance?  Use full sentences.**

During my undergraduate years, I had the opportunity to briefly experience using laser cutting and Rhino. I thought it wouldn't be too difficult, but it turned out to be more challenging than I anticipated. (I faced difficulties from the moment I opened the Rhino program.) Rather than meeting my personal expectations, my proficiency with Rhino was still quite low, which was disappointing. However, I plan to look for tutorials and put in more effort to improve in the future.

What truly helped with my progress was the assistance of the design specialist. When I visited the makers space in a somewhat urgent situation, the design specialist patiently guided me in a way that was easy to understand, enabling me to complete the task. I regret not seeking help earlier and I've realized the importance of being more proactive in asking questions and seeking advice in the future.

One positive aspect I want to highlight about my achievements is that I diligently documented the usage and settings of Rhino, Grasshopper, and laser cutting techniques through photos and notes, so that I can remember them when using them in the future. Additionally, I find it enjoyable to explore GitHub, which I'm using for the first time. While I started the assignment a bit late and didn't have the chance to 'physically' assist my classmates, I was glad to help a few friends with things like finding information about laser cutting reservations or setting up GitHub repositories.

**In this writing, reflect thoughtfully on your cohort's performance since the week.  Was there anything that surprised you? Are you grateful for assistance from a classmate? Is there anything that you can contribute that would improve the experience? Use full sentences.**

 Actually when I first opened Rhino, I only saw a simple circle and couldn't see any objects. Like this, I found it difficult to follow the assignment instructions, as there were no specific solutions provided. Also, I had to search for information from various sources like the wiki, GitHub, bcourse, Google Drive, and more, which made the task challenging. I was impressed by how everyone seemed to easily find the necessary information and complete the assignment.
 
 It was also nice to see how people were reusing materials effectively even if no one told to do that. Furthermore, when I mentioned that I was having trouble finding time for laser cutting, a friend offered to split their reserved time with me. (In the end, I managed to make a reservation myself.) 
 
 It would be great if we have a clear outline of exactly what tasks need to be done by the deadline.(Maybe I could do that!) Also, I hope I can help friends around me and contribute to their learning after becoming more familiar with the software.
