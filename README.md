# [Week of 08/31/2023] Computational Design #1
I learned how to use Rhino, at first, it was also difficult to get a grip on the four quadrants on the Rhino's screen.
Now I can set display mode set to "Wireframe". 

**Command function**
Since there are too many icons and functions in the program, it's convenient to use "Command" function like this.

I used more commands below.
- 4View
- _Group(or Ctrl+G)
- Grasshopper(to open Grasshopper)

**Placing objects**
- Set Layer (when you export, it will automatically be red and easy to cut)
- The pieces were placed out of the board, so I used "move to 0" so that it is visible in the illustrator.
- The grid didn't show up, so typed "Grid" and changed "ShowGridAxes=Yes", "ShowGrid=Yes"

**Customizing Phonestand to my phone**
1) Measuring

2) Adjusting Phone Size

3) Adjusting Student Activity Range and Height

"Well...While taking pictures of the process of measuring the phone size with an iPad, I felt once again that I needed a phonestand!"

The specific file that I’m typing into right now is the **README.md** for this repo. 
##### (💡 TIP: The .md indicates that we’re using [Markdown formatting.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) #####
<h6> (💡 TIP 2: GitHub Markdown supports <a href="https://gist.github.com/seanh/13a93686bf4c2cb16e658b3cf96807f2"> <em>HTML formatting</em> too, including emojis 😄</a>, in case that helps!) </h6>

### :star: Whatever you write in your **README.md** will show up on the “front page” of your GitHub repo. This is where we’ll be looking for your [weekly progress reports](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/desinv-202/wiki/3.0-Weekly-Submissions). They might look something like this: ###

# Example Report 1 - Week of 08/21/2023 #
This week, I designed a cool phone stand made of rocks. Check out all my cool sketches and progress photos from this week below, etc., etc....

or, if you prefer, you can create separate files and link to them here, like so:

---
[Example Report 1](weekly-reports/example-report-1.md)

Either way, it's time to start making this space your own! If you want to save these instructions -- Don't worry, I already copied them over to another file for you [here.](welcomeREADME.md) So feel empowered to delete everything in this README.md and start documenting! 

sparkles,

your TDF TA, shm :sparkles:

PS: let me know if you have any questions!!
