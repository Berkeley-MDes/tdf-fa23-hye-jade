# [Week of 08/31/2023] Computational Design #1
I learned how to use Rhino, at first, it was also difficult to get a grip on the four quadrants on the Rhino's screen.
Now I can set display mode set to "Wireframe". 

**Command function**
- Since there are too many icons and functions in the program, it's convenient to use "Command" function like this.

I used more commands below.
- 4View
- _Group(or Ctrl+G)
- Grasshopper(to open Grasshopper)

**Placing objects**
- Set Layer and color code it. When you export, it will automatically be red and easy to adjust for cutting.
- The pieces were placed out of the board, so I used "move to 0" so that it is visible in the illustrator.
- The grid didn't show up, so typed "Grid" and changed "ShowGridAxes=Yes", "ShowGrid=Yes"
- It's Cody's little tips! His favorite settings are like this, and it is convenient to use! 'Onsnap' makes it easier to draw lines.

**Customizing Phonestand to my phone**
1) Measuring
I need to consider the phonecase sizes as well. It was --> H * W * T = 150 * 75 * 12

*"Well...While taking pictures of the process of measuring the phone size with an iPad, I felt once again that I needed a phonestand!"*

3) Adjusting Phone Size

**Bake**
- To make it as a 2D model, I should 'bake' it in Grasshopper.

**Laser cutting**




**Results**
Succeed!
